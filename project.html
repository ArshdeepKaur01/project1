        <p class="sectionsubtag ">The actual schedule of car maintenance varies depending on the year, make, and model of a car, its driving conditions, and driver behavior. Carmakers recommend the so-called extreme or the ideal service schedule based on impact parameters such as
            the number of trips and distance traveled per trip per day
            extreme hot or cold climate conditions
            mountainous, dusty, or DE-iced roads
            heavy stop-and-go vs. long-distance cruising
            towing a trailer or other heavy load
            Service advisers in dealerships and independent shops recommend schedule intervals, which are often in between the ideal or extreme service schedule
            Maintenance tasks commonly carried out during a motor vehicle service include:

Change the engine oil[1] Replace the oil filter Replace the air filter Replace the fuel filter Replace the cabin a/c filter Replace the spark plugs
Check level and refill brake fluid/clutch fluid check Brake pads/Liners, Brake discs/Drums, and replace if worn out
Check Coolant Hoses Check the charging systems Check the battery Check level and refill power steering fluid
Check level and refill Automatic/Manual Transmission Fluid Grease and lubricate component
Inspect and replace the timing belt or timing chain if neededCheck condition of the tire
Rotate Tires Check for proper operation of all lights, wipers, etc.Check for any error codes in the ECU and take corrective action.
Use a scan tool to read trouble code.
Mechanical parts that may cause the car to cease transmission or prove unsafe for the road are also noted and advised upon.
In the United Kingdom, few parts that are not inspected on the MOT test are inspected and advised upon a Service Inspection, including clutch, gearbox, car battery, and engine components (further inspections than MOT).
